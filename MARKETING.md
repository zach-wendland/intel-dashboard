**Title:** "I built a news aggregator for patriots - no algorithms, no censorship"

**Body:**
```
Hey everyone,

I got tired of:
- Missing Nick Fuentes streams because Kick doesn't notify me
- Checking 10 different sites for conservative news
- YouTube's algorithm hiding content I actually want to see
- InfoWars, Tucker, and Bannon all on different platforms

So I built America First Intelligence Grid.

It's a single dashboard that shows:
- 30+ live streamers (Kick, Rumble, YouTube, Twitch) - Fuentes, Tate, InfoWars, Tucker, Crowder, SNEAKO, etc.
- Real-time RSS feeds from InfoWars, Breitbart, ZeroHedge, Gateway Pundit, Revolver, American Greatness
- Bookmarks and reading history
- Analytics on what's trending in patriot media

No login required. No tracking. No ads (yet). Just the content.

Instead:
1. Tag them in launch tweets
2. Email their business/media contact (if public)
3. Post in their communities (Cozy.tv chat, InfoWars forums)
4. Wait for organic growth, then reach out with traffic stats

**Email Template for Business Contact:**
